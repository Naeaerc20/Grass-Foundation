# GRASS Foundation

Hello! This is a tool that Will help you to hndle multiple isntantes(devices) to farm GRASS Airdrop Seasson 2
The code is able to handle errors like disconnection, 4001, nggyu, 4003, 1001 etc... Many others incluing invalid proxies and auto removal.

My advice would be use proxies from 2captcha service provider ideally ISP Proxies to make your instances to look more real. Secondly, create various GRASS Accounts from different devices and add a lot of proxies to proxies.txt file - the code will automatoically distribute all proxies between all accounts to make it match in same or almost same amount of devices.

Solid Ws Connections to avoid missing points, proxy rotation is every 2 hours - if you have a better proxy provider with larger duiration time that would be sweet if could share.

Add proxies in format socks5://login:pass@ip:port

Added "indexv2.js" uses different mechanic to connect Ws sessions - Quick Advise use proxies with Multilogin config if you're using proxies from 2captcha like me. It helps to keep connections much more stronger
Example: https://prnt.sc/Lv0aUGjMfb90 - Add at least 15 proxies per user added in the code
